# Love Rank Pulse Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Love Rank Pulse project, a real-time leaderboard system for a multiplayer shooter game. The testing plan covers unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and performance benchmarks to ensure the application meets its functional and performance requirements.

## Testing Objectives

1. Verify that all components function correctly in isolation
2. Ensure proper integration between services and the API Gateway
3. Validate key user flows from end to end
4. Measure and optimize performance against established benchmarks
5. Identify and address potential bottlenecks

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests will focus on testing individual components, services, and utilities in isolation.

#### Components to Test:

- **UI Components**
  - Header
  - FilterBar
  - LeaderboardTable
  - LeaderboardRow
  - MyStatsModal
  - AuthModal (LoginForm, RegisterForm)

- **Services**
  - PlayerService
  - MatchService
  - LeaderboardService
  - ApiGatewayAdapter

- **Utilities**
  - leaderboardUtils
  - statsUtils
  - mockDataGenerators

#### Testing Framework:
- Jest for test runner
- React Testing Library for component testing
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

#### Test Coverage Targets:
- 80% line coverage for services and utilities
- 70% line coverage for UI components

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests will verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

#### Integration Points to Test:

- **API Gateway and Services**
  - Verify that the API Gateway correctly routes requests to the appropriate service
  - Test authentication middleware with various token scenarios
  - Validate error handling and response formatting

- **Service Interactions**
  - Test interactions between PlayerService and LeaderboardService
  - Verify that MatchService updates trigger appropriate LeaderboardService updates
  - Test caching mechanisms in the API Gateway

#### Testing Approach:
- Use Jest for test runner
- Create test fixtures for common test data
- Mock external dependencies as needed

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests will validate complete user flows from the UI through all layers of the application.

#### User Flows to Test:

- **Authentication**
  - User registration
  - User login
  - Session persistence
  - Logout

- **Leaderboard Viewing**
  - View session leaderboard
  - Filter and sort leaderboard data
  - Navigate between session, country, and global leaderboards
  - View personal stats

- **Responsive Design**
  - Test UI on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
  - Verify mobile-first approach works correctly

#### Testing Tools:
- Cypress for E2E testing
- Percy for visual regression testing

### 4. Performance Testing

Performance tests will measure the application against established benchmarks.

#### Performance Metrics to Test:

- **Page Load Time**
  - Initial page load: Target < 1 second
  - Subsequent navigation: Target < 500ms

- **Leaderboard Update Latency**
  - Time from match completion to leaderboard update: Target < 2 seconds

- **API Response Time**
  - All API endpoints: Target < 500ms

- **Concurrent User Simulation**
  - Support for 100 concurrent users without degradation

#### Testing Tools:
- Lighthouse for page load metrics
- Custom performance measurement utilities
- k6 for load testing

## Test Data Management

- Create comprehensive mock data sets for all test types
- Develop data generators for creating test scenarios
- Ensure test data covers edge cases and error conditions

## Test Environment

- Local development environment for unit and integration tests
- Staging environment for E2E and performance tests
- CI/CD pipeline integration for automated testing

## Test Utilities and Helpers

### Test Data Generators
- Player data generator
- Match data generator
- Leaderboard data generator

### Mock Service Responses
- Mock API responses for all endpoints
- Simulate various error conditions
- Create realistic response delays for performance testing

### Performance Measurement Tools
- Page load time measurement utility
- API response time logger
- Leaderboard update latency tracker
- Concurrent user simulation tool

## Test Reporting

- Generate detailed test reports for all test types
- Track test coverage over time
- Document performance metrics with baseline comparisons
- Identify and prioritize performance bottlenecks

## Continuous Integration

- Run unit and integration tests on every pull request
- Run E2E tests on merge to main branch
- Run performance tests on a scheduled basis
- Block merges if tests fail or performance degrades significantly

## Test Schedule

1. Set up testing framework and dependencies
2. Implement test utilities and helpers
3. Create unit tests for core components and services
4. Implement integration tests for API Gateway and service interactions
5. Create E2E tests for key user flows
6. Set up performance benchmarking tools
7. Measure and optimize performance metrics
8. Document test results and performance metrics
