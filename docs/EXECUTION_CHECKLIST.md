## Emergency Rollback Procedure

If any day encounters critical issues:

1. **Stop execution immediately**
2. **Document the issue**
   ```bash
   echo "Issue: [description]" >> .swarm/logs/issues.log
   ```
3. **Rollback to last checkpoint**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   git reset --hard <last-good-commit>
   ```
4. **Review swarm output for errors**
   ```bash
   cat .swarm/outputs/day-X/errors.log
   ```
5. **Fix issues before proceeding**
6. **Re-run verification steps**
7. **Continue when stable**
