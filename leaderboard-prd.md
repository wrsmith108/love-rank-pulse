- Plays 3-5 matches per session
- Interested in session performance and improvement
- Values seeing their stats even if not top-ranked
- Engagement driver: Personal progress tracking

**Competitive Player (Secondary - 30%)**
- Plays 10+ matches per session
- Focused on climbing global/country rankings
- Analyzes K/D ratios and win rates
